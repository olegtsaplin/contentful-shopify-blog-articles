# Contentful x Shopify Blog Articles

Adds a custom UI field to Contentful that allows users to search and select Shopify blog articles. It's the same thing as the official [Contentful Shopify Product Extension](https://github.com/contentful/extensions/tree/master/samples/shopify), but for blog articles.

To make the UI extension work you'll need a valid [Storefront API token](https://help.shopify.com/api/reference/access/storefrontaccesstoken) with `unauthenticated_read_content` scope and the API endpoint of your Shopify store.
